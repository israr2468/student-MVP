### Application Requirements
## Single Page Express Application with Persistent Storage:

# Client Side Code

    HTML / CSS

        Focus on functionality first, but overall, your application should be well formatted and look somewhat refined. See preparing for your project.
        Boxes, buttons, text, should not be misaligned. Good use of color and negative space.
        Must Use CSS Flexbox, layout should be clean with and must have a header and footer.
        Must incorporate atleast one nice looking font: Open fonts from Google  . If you click on a font, and then "+ select this style" you'll get a <link...> tag to include in to your HTML head, and the CSS rule for you to include the font.

    Javascript

        Must respond to user interaction and provide data from your Express API
        This is a single page application, so the client only gets a single "index.html" page with all of the CSS, JS files linked to it. You can simulate multiple pages when a user clicked on something, simply by hiding what is already on the page, and showing content that was previously hidden. jQuery Hide Function  , jQuery Show Function 
        
    Server Side Code

        Must follow RESTful API convention
        Well formatted and indented code

    Database

        Must have atleast 1 table that stores User data

    Deployment

        Deploy early: Must have immediate initial deployment before app is finished
        Final product must be deployed to Heroku

    Workflow

        Must show frequent commits, latest code pushed to github

    Bonus

        Incorporate an external library or API (beware of picking an API without doing research first, make sure it is open or if it needs a key that you can get one quickly!)
        You are welcome to go beyond the above requirements, but focus on MVP - Minimal Viable Product. In other words focus on what truly makes your application unique or special, only include those features, and no other fluff.


## Example High Level Project Ideas

Based on your skillset thus far you should be able to build just about any kind of application. Consider existing websites and platforms that you could build a new MVP version of. For example:

    A to do list that stores everything in a database
    A fitness / exercise tracker
    A goal tracker
    A new social media application
    A velocity tracker for a student's accomplishments during class
    A volunteer matcher for opportunities at local charities
